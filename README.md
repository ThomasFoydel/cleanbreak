I made this because drum machines are cool and people should be able to experiment with music production without having to install anything beyond their browser.

Beats are programmable using the sequencer grid. Little grey squares make no sound. Black squares will play the sample loaded into that rack. Red squares will play the sample, but louder. The sliders below the sequencer can be used to mix the volume/panning of individual samples, or send the samples to various effects.

Presets can be saved, edited, or deleted if a user signs in.
